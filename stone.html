    <p>At 1:20am on June 28, 1969, police officers (4 plainclothes, 2 patrol officers, a detective and a deputy inspector) entered the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of lower Manhattan, NYC, NY. </p>
    <p>“Police! We’re taking the place!” </p>
    <p>The raid did not go as planned.   SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) was to line everyone up and check IDs.  Patrons perceived as being female were taken to the restroom by female officers to verify their gender.  Trans-women and “drag queens” were subsequently arrested.   </p>
    <p>On this night, the female patrons refused to go with the officers and the male patrons being held in line refused to produce identification.    As a result, officers on the scene decided to take all those in attendance to the station after having separated those they suspected of being cross-dressers.   It was at this point that the sense of discomfort began to spread, due to perceived assaults while police were frisking suspects. </p>
    <p>While awaiting patrol wagons to transport suspects and confiscated alcohol, the crowd outside the inn, comprised mostly of homosexual males, some of who were patrons that had been allowed to leave, began to grow and was now ten times the size of the group being held for arrest. </p>
    <p>As police escorted one of the female patrons outside to the now waiting patrol wagon, she began struggling and escaping from the officers.  She was hit in the head with a baton, which angered the gathered crowd.  Officers then began trying to control the onlookers, knocking some of them to the ground, which caused the fear and anger to grow. </p>
    <p>The crowd then began attacking the police wagons, overturning at least one.  The officers, now outnumbered by as many as 600 barricaded themselves and some of the remaining arrested patrons inside the inn.  By 4:00am, most of the mob had been cleared and the event appeared to be over. </p>
    <p>The following night, however, a crowd again gathered outside the inn and caused disruptions up and down Christopher Street and the surrounding blocks.   The riots would continue for another 4 nights as more and more gay Americans began to demand their rights. </p>
    <p>The Stonewall Riots are widely considered to be the birth of the modern LGBTQ+ movement. </p>
