      <p>At 4:00am on July 16, 1969, NASA Director of Flight Operations, Deke Slayton, roused 3 men from their sleep.   It was time for Flight Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin to go to work.  3 hours later they were on Launch Pad 39A in the command module “Columbia”, atop NASA’s Saturn V rocket.   Three and a half hours after that, they were on their way to the moon. </p>
      <p>On July 19, “Columbia” entered lunar orbit and for 30 lunar orbits, the three men looked out their windows to see the surface the look for the proposed landing spot, “The Sea of Tranquility.” </p>
      <p>Early in the morning of July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin entered the mission’s Lunar Module (LEM), “The Eagle.”  This is the vehicle that would ascend to the surface.  As the two pilots continued their descent to the lunar surface, they noticed that they were passing their established landmarks up to 3 minutes earlier than expected and that they would miss their intended landing zone by miles.  This was only the first problem the pilots and the ground crew in Houston would encounter. </p>
      <p>Five minutes in the descent, and nearly 6000 feet above the surface, the LEM guidance computer began signaling 2 errors. Error 1201 and Error 1202.  Armstrong and Aldrin waited for confirmation on the errors and their meaning.  At mission control, Flight Director Gene Kranz pressured his team for answers.  If they didn’t have them fast, they may be forced to abort the mission, just a mile from completion.  Within seconds, engineers Jack Garman and Steve Bales advised that the errors were just the computer advising it couldn’t complete all requested tasks, but it was safe to continue the descent. </p>
      <p>They then had to deal with the next problem.  Diminishing fuel levels.  Due to “The Eagle” passing landmark points early and landing long, Armstrong noticed that the LEM would now be landing in a crater the size of a football stadium.  To avoid this, he took manual control of the LEM and began guiding it to a safer landing site.  This burned a lot more fuel than intended.  As they moved closer to the surface, they began to run dangerously low.  Kranz and his crew were again faced with a decision.  At what point to decide there was not enough fuel remaining and to abort the mission. </p>
      <p>Luckily, Armstrong found a spot and with some guidance from the computers and Aldrin was able to land “The Eagle”.  When the LEM touched down, they had enough fuel for just 18 more seconds of flight.  The 2 men would remain in the LEM for an additional 6 and a half hours before finally exiting the vehicle. </p>
      <p>At 9:40pm Eastern time, as millions of people all over the world watched on TV, the hatch on “The Eagle” opened and Armstrong began his exit.  At 9:56pm, Neil Armstrong became the first human to step foot on the moon. </p>
      <p>“That’s on small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,” </p>
      <p>Approximately 20 minutes later, Aldrin joined Armstong on the surface.  He described his view as “Magnificent Desolation.” </p>
      <p>The 2 men were on the lunar surface for 21 and a half hours.  At 12:54pm on July 21, the ascent stage of the LEM fired and “The Eagle” was back in flight to rendezvous with “Columbia” and the 3 men could return home. </p>
