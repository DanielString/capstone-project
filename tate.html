        <h2>Tate Murders</h2>
      <p>At approximately 10:00pm on August 8, 1969, actress Sharon Tate Polanski, hairdresser Jay Sebring, coffee heiress Abigail Folger and her fiancé Wojciech Frykowski returned to the Polanski home at 10050 Cielo Drive*, in the Benedict Canyon region of Los Angeles.  Sharon was 8 months pregnant and it was a brutally hot, muggy night, so their plane was to relax for the remainder of the evening. </p>
      <p>At that same time, cult leader Charles Manson sent four of his followers out from their home at Spahn’s Movie Ranch in Chatsworth. The official court records state it was to begin a race war. The reason is up for debate. The results are not.   </p>
      <p>Charles “Tex” Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle and Linda Kasabian arrived at the Cielo Drive address just after midnight on August 9.  According to those involved, they first encountered a car driven by 18 year old Stephen Parent, a friend of the property caretaker, William Garretson.  After pleading for mercy, Parent was shot 4 times.  Shortly after, chaos ensued as Watson, Atkins and Krenwinkle savagely beat, stabbed and shot all those remaining at the home.  Before leaving, Atkins took a towel dipped in Sharon Tate’s blood and wrote the word “PIG” on the front door. </p>
      <p>When the bodies were discovered the following day, the only person left alive on the property, Garretson, was arrested.  He was later cleared and police were left with a frightened LA area pressuring them to solve these murders. </p>
      <p class="ft-note">*The original home was torn down in 1995.  When the current home on the site was completed, the address was changed to 10066.  The final resident of the 10050 home was Nine Inch Nails frontman, Trent Reznor.  When he left, he took the front door, that had “PIG” scrawled on it, and installed it in his studio in New Orleans, LA. </p>

      <h2>LaBianca Murders</h2>
      <p>On the evening of August 9, 1969, Manson again summoned the members of his group to again head into Los Angeles to further the onset of the race war.  This time, Charlie joined the crew and wandered around the greater LA area looking for potential victims.  Ultimately, he settled on a house at  3301 Waverly Drive* in the Los Feliz section of the city, near Griffith Park.  This was the home of supermarket owner Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary. </p>
      <p>Manson entered the home in the early hours of August 10.  He tied up the couple and advised that he would not hurt them, it was just a robbery.  He then left and Watson, Krenwinkle and another member of the group, Leslie Van Houten entered the home and killed the couple.  Before leaving, the group wrote several words in blood.  On the walls in the living room were the words “DEATH TO PIGS” and “RISE” and on the refrigerator in the kitchen was written the phrase that would come to define the entire case “HEALTER SKELTER”, a misspelling of the title of The Beatles song, “Helter Skelter.” </p>
      <p class="ft-note">*While the original home still exists and is pretty much the same as it was on the evening of August 9, 1969, the address was changed to 3311 Waverly Drive. </p>
      <p>Despite the similarities to the Cielo murders the night before, it would be months before the Los Angeles police would connect the cases and those responsible were not apprehended until November of 1969. </p>
