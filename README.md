# capstone-project

We will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to tell the story of the Summer of 1969 in the United States of America.

The Summer of 1969
Overview
My capstone project for CODE:You. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to tell the fascinating story of the 3 months that comprised the summer of 1969 in the United States.

I created mobile responsive pages, including calendars, that will provide bits of pop culture and history that can be used to advance ones personal knowledge or help the win trivia night.

Features Utilized:
HTML 5
CSS
JavaScript
Google API

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/DanielString/capstone-project.git

I reached to get the Google Map API to get a closer look at the locations I wanted to spotlight, but I was unable to work out how to do so, so when accessing the maps, what is seen is a wider view than intended.
