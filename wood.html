    <p>In January or 1969, four men, Michael Lang, Artie Kornfeld, Joel Rosenman and John Roberts formed a partnership.  The idea; to build a recording studio in the town of Woodstock in upstate New York and put on a small concert to offset the cost of construction.  Rosenman and Roberts had no interest in building another recording studio, having just completed a similar project in Manhattan.  The idea of a concert and a part, on the other hand, did interest them.  As a result, the project moved in that direction. </p>
    <p>Problems arose almost immediately.  The residents of Woodstock quickly rejected the idea of having such an event in the area, which left the group scrambling for a site.  Lang and Kornfeld quickly found another potential site in the town of Saugerties, NY.  This location quickly fell by the wayside and the site’s owner refused permission to use the land. </p>
    <p>Rosenman and Roberts eventually found a site, an industrial park, in the town of Wallkill.  The deal was signed in the spring and construction began on the site.  Once the residents learned that counter culture youth (referred to as “Hippies”) from all over would be descending on the town, they protested.  In turn, the Wallkill town board passed a law stating that special permits would be required to allow a crowd larger than 5000 people.  given that it was now July and the concert was scheduled for mid-August, the town of Wallkill was now no longer an option. </p>
    <p>In looking for yet another location, Lang and Kornfeld found the ideal location.  A natural amphitheater set in the dairy farm of Max Yasgur in the small town of Bethal, NY.  Despite more protests from local residents, Yasgur held firm on his position, and construction began on the security gates and stage. </p>
    <p>The signing of acts was also a challenge, but they quartet managed to land most of the acts they were seeking.  The first to sign was Creedance Clearwater Revival.  They also were able to land the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Crosby Still & Nash, The Who, and to close the festival, Jimi Hendrix. </p>
    <p>One act that likely owes its career to “Woodstock” was a band that at the time, was little known outside the San Francisco Bay area, “Santana”.  Leader Carlos Santana, under the influence of LSD, made his name at the concert with his song, “Soul Sacrifice”. </p>
    <p>The next major hurdle the partnership had to get over was, by far the biggest.  The crowd.  The had planned for roughly 50,000 people a day (150,000 over the weekend), most of whom would leave at the end of each night, to return in the morning.  To their shock and partial horror, half a million people came, and stayed.   Since collecting admission was next to impossible, the concert became a free event and as a money-making venture, the idea was dead.  This also led to shortages in just about every area.  There wasn’t enough food, restrooms or medical supplies to care for everyone.  For a time, the Governor of New York, Nelson Rockefeller, considered shutting the event down.  Wiser minds interceded and the state offered additional resources to help and keep the event going.  With the crowd of 500,000, there were only 3 fatalities over the 3 and a half days.  Two drug overdoses and one accident with a collection tractor and an attendee in a sleeping bag. </p>
    <p>The final problem was one that could not be foreseen, the weather.  On Sunday, August 17, just after Joe Cocker had completed his set, a massive thunderstorm hit the area and delayed the concert for an additional 3 hours.  It also led to electrical issues on the stage and many exposed power lines that threatened the spectators.  Luckily, other than delays and making a mussy mess of Yasgur’s field, the rain caused no lasting damage. </p>
    <p>Because of multiple delays, Hendrix didn’t take the stage until 9:00am on Monday, August 18.  By then the crowd had dwindled from half a million to about 40,000.  That did not stop Jimi from delivering one of the decades iconic moments.  A feedback laden rendition of “The Star Spangled Banner”.</p>
